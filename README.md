# TP3_4_SPP
multithreaded image filtering



## About

This project is a practical session about multiThreading.

Based on a filter interface and a engine interface, we build two kinds of filtering engine :


We first implemented a version of the filtering engine without thread, to demonstrate that this is slow.

Then we implemented the multithreaded version.

The both versions takes the same kind of filters implementing IFilter interface.
